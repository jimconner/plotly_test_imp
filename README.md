#Some test code for using the Imp Plotly Library

I was having trouble getting the Imp to talk to Plotly after 9th Nov 2015, so I wrote some test code using the new electricimp plotly library.

This just generates random numbers on the device (no hardware required - works on any Imp), and then sends them over to the agent to be forwarded onto plot.ly

Seems to work.
